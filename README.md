# AudioProcessing2025 🎧

This repository contains all the work related to audio processing for the upcoming *Hackathon at VIT* in collaboration with *Samsung R&D*.  
The project focuses on *speech de-reverberation*, aiming to clean echo-affected audio using signal processing and neural network techniques.

---

## 📁 Contents

- notebooks/ – Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and model development  
- audio_samples/ – Sample audio files (with and without echo)  
- spectrograms/ – Spectrogram visualizations of the input and output  
- results/ – Model outputs, metrics, and comparisons  

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

- *Librosa, **NumPy, **Matplotlib* for signal analysis  
- *PyTorch / TensorFlow* (planned) for deep learning models  
- *Colab / Jupyter Notebooks* for running and saving experiments  
- *GitHub* for version control and documentation  

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a working pipeline that can:

- Detect and suppress echo in audio recordings  
- Visualize changes in spectrograms post-processing  
- Build a foundational model for real-world dereverberation tasks  

---

## 📅 Timeline

- *Start Date:* June 13, 2025  
- *End Date:* August 28, 2025  

This repository will be regularly updated throughout the duration of the Samsung R&D Hackathon.

## ✅ Expected Outcome / Future Scope

- A de-reverberated audio processing model built using classical and ML-based techniques  
- Comparison results using *PESQ, **STOI, and **SDR* metrics  
- Ready-to-demo project for *Samsung R&D Research Internship* selection  
- Thorough documentation of code, experiment results, and insights
